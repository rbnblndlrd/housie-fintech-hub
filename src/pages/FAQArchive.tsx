        {
          question: "What is the HOUSIE fee?",

      questions: [
        {
          question: "How do payments work?",
          answer: "All payments are processed securely through Stripe. Customers pay when booking, and providers receive payment after service completion. We hold funds in escrow for protection."
        },
        {
          question: "When do providers get paid?",
          answer: "Providers receive payment 24-48 hours after the customer marks the service as complete. This ensures quality and gives time for any issues to be resolved."

        {
          question: "What payment methods are accepted?",
          answer: "We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, and bank transfers through our secure Stripe integration. Payment methods are saved for convenience on future bookings."

        },
        {
          question: "What documents do I need to provide?",
          answer: "Basic requirements include government ID, business license (if applicable), insurance certificate, and banking information for payments. Additional certifications may be required for specialized services."
        },
        {

        {
          question: "Can I cancel or reschedule a booking?",
          answer: "Yes, you can cancel or reschedule up to 24 hours before the service time without penalty. Last-minute cancellations may incur a small fee that goes to the provider for their time."
        },
        {
          question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the service?",
          answer: "Contact our support team immediately. We have a resolution process that includes refunds, service credits, or rebooking with another provider. Your satisfaction is guaranteed."
        },
        {
          question: "How do reviews work?",
          answer: "After each service, both customers and providers can leave reviews. This builds trust and helps maintain service quality. Reviews are verified and cannot be deleted once posted."
