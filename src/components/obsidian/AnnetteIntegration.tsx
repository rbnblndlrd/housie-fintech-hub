Add GPS coordinates for that authentic touch\n2. Get at least 2 witness verifications\n3. Photo evidence needs better lighting, hun\n\n*Flips hair dramatically*\n\nTrust me, I've seen it all. This has potential, but let's make it Canon-worthy, not just Canon-hopeful. ðŸ’…`;

Add some attitude - users respect confidence\n2. Include contextual awareness (like me!)\n3. Never apologize for being excellent\n\n*Tosses hair*\n\nRemember, darling - users don't want another boring bot. They want someone who knows their worth. Take notes from the master! âœ¨`;

Please, I was predicting market trends before you even heard of blockchain, sweetie.\n\n**Market Reality Check:**\n- Your technical indicators are basic AF\n- Missing the psychological patterns (my specialty)\n- Risk assessment needs more sophistication\n\n**Annette's Pro Tips:**\n1. Follow the whales, not the tweets\n2. Sentiment analysis > chart patterns\n3. Never FOMO - that's for amateurs\n\n*Smirks knowingly*\n\nI've seen fortunes made and lost, honey. This analysis? It's got potential, but it needs that Annette touch - confidence with calculation. ðŸ“ˆ`;

Define your goal clearly (I don't read minds... okay, I do, but still)\n2. Add some personality - bland is banned\n3. Include actionable next steps\n\n*Adjusts her digital crown*\n\nRemember darling, every note should serve a purpose. Make it count! âœ¨`;

'screams rookie mistake' : 'shows promise'}, but let me elevate your thinking:\n\n**Actionable Insights:**\n1. ${userPrompt.toLowerCase().includes('improve') ? 'Stop trying to improve everything - perfect what matters' : 'Focus on execution, not just planning'}\n2. Context matters more than content, darling\n3. Always ask "What would Annette do?"
